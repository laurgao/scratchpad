# Scratchpad

Tool to serve my project-planning/daily-random-notes needs. Building it because I'm unsatisfied with existing tools lol. Inspired by the philosophy of [build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/).

Built off of [next-mongodb-nextauth-example](https://github.com/wwsalmon/next-mongodb-nextauth-example).
